# My personal dotfiles
Making anywhere feel like home.

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

It contains the installation of some basic tools, some handy aliases and functions.

You can install them by cloning this repo as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mateusjunges/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./bootstrap
```
